# nvim

---

## Motivation:

- The Primeagen uses it
- It looks fun
- VSCode started to annoy me with all the AI bloat
- I'm on Linux now. Got to go full open source and embrace the change

> [!IMPORTANT] When you install neovim
> Use [bob](https://github.com/MordechaiHadad/bob) when installing neovim for the first time. The build version
> should be as up to date as possible, otherwise you'll get errors due to old
> LuaJIT and Lua versions
